# .dotfiles
This is my personal repository for terminal configs on mac and linux. Probably no-one will find this, but I wrote installation instructions in case anyone does.

Right now it works on Mac and Fedora, and I'm working on adding support for Arch-based distros, OpenSUSE, and Debian-based distros.
